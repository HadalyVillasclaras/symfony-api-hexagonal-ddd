## :satellite: DDD API / Hexagonal / Clean Architecture

Books Library API crafted with Symfony applying Hexagonal(Ports and Adapters) Architecture with Vertical Slicing and Screaming Architecture, while implementing Domain-Driven Design (DDD) software approach.

This application serves as a creative playground for me to apply and refine my understanding of Clean Architecture and DDD principles. As I dive deeper into these concepts and keep learning, this project highlights my growth and love for software architecture and desgin patterns.

[Work in progress :hammer_and_wrench:]
